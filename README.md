# Timeshift influxDB proxy with Mathematics across measurements feature

This proxy server will add *timeshift* feature to you *influxDB* server. This feature is extremely helpful to compare periods in *Grafana*.

Proxy can to mathematical operations between queries (i.e. between metrics).

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/maxsivanov/influxdb-timeshift-proxy.git
cd influxdb-timeshift-proxy
npm i
INFLUXDB=192.168.33.11:8086 npm run start 
```

Proxy will be available on port 8089.  

## Usage

Proxy will go timeshift on queries with fields listed with alias `AS "shift_1_weeks"`. `1` can be any positive integer number. `weeks` can be`years|months|weeks|days|hours|minutes|seconds`.

You can use `MATH` query to do mathematical operation between previously defined queries.

![Example of MATH query](math_example.png)

* `name` and `expr` attributes are mandatory. 
* You can use any mathematical operation in `expr`: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`. 
* `$0`, `$1` ... etc are indexes of query results to be used in expression.
* `Infinity` and `NaN` results will be converted to `null`, so do not be afraid of division by zero.   
* `MATH` will clear returned values from query results used for mathematical operation. Use `keep` attribute to keep source data.

## Example requests

Shift one week back:

```
SELECT non_negative_derivative("value", 1h) AS "shift_1_weeks" FROM "CPU_LOAD" WHERE "tag" = 'all' 
```

Shift two days back:

```
SELECT non_negative_derivative("value", 1h) AS "shift_2_days" FROM "CPU_LOAD" WHERE "tag" = 'all' 
```

Sum two metrics and **clear** source metrics from result 

```
MATH name="ALL" expr="$0 + $1"
```

Sum two metrics and **keep** source metrics in result 

```
MATH name="ALL" expr="$0 + $1" keep="$0,$1"
```
